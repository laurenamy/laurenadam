One of the few things anyone needs to know about me is that I'm a lifelong learner. I love **learning new things**, from the outside causes of the French Revolution to the constant new dev technologies that are created.

Things I like (in no particular order) include:

* knitting
* video games
* programming
* spending time with my partner, dog, and cats
* playing tabletop games
* traveling
* fall/winter

Things I don't like:

* spiders
