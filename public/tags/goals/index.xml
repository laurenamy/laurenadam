      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be 30 next year, and while the idea terrifies me, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way in these last few years specifically. I finally made the long desired jump into a career in tech, my personal life is fabulous, and things really can&amp;rsquo;t get much better.
Except that they totally can.
While this is far too late to be considered new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve made some goals for myself recently that I hope to accomplish rather quickly.</description>
